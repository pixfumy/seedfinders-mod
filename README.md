# seedfinders-mod
Makes pre1.9 seedfinders' jobs easier by adding a new `/rates` command.

## Usage

`/rates` will tell you the current rates on the world you're in in the following output: 

![rates](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95588510/186546483-557a7da0-8168-4bb9-98e0-1effe08bc629.png)

`/rates <seedName> reset` will allow you to reset the seed for one source of RNG. For example, if `/rates` tells you you have bad blaze rates, you can do `/rates blazeRodSeed reset` and then check again with `/rates`. Repeat until you're happy with the RNG. Note that the seeds are auto-completable and you do not need to memorize them.

Works in conjunction with [Pre1.9 Racemod](https://github.com/marinersfan824/racemod/releases/tag/v5.8.0).
